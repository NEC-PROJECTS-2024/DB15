### INTRODUCTION:

Attrition is the departure of employees from the organization for any reason (voluntary or involuntary), including resignation, termination, death or retirement. Attrition rate refers to the rate at which employees leave a company over a specified period of time. It is typically expressed as a percentage and is calculated by dividing the number of employees who leave the company (voluntarily or involuntarily) by the average number of employees during that period, and then multiplying by 100. Attrition can be caused by a variety of factors, including dissatisfaction with the job, a poor work environment, or a desire for a better salary or benefits. The attrition reports are seen by the human resources department and the manager of the department where the employee who left work worked. we have implemented various Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the attrition rate of an organization. We have followed various processes such as Dataset Collection, Data Preprocessing, Data Visualization, apply SMOTE on the data and training the model by using the various machine learning models like Random Forest, Decision Tree, Extra Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boost and XG Boost Classifier algorithms. The results are evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix. XG Boost classifier algorithm giving the best accuracy i.e., 90.14% compared to the other evaluating models. This work will help organizations to better understand the attrition causes.
